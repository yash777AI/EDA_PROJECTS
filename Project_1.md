## PROJECT_1 Summary of Tasks

1. **Importing Data**: We use pandas to read a CSV file into a DataFrame (`df`).
2. **Data Frames**: We use pandas methods like `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()` to inspect the DataFrame.
3. **Variables**: Each column in the dataset is considered a variable (e.g., `'RM'`, `'CRIM'`, `'MEDV'`).
4. **Data Transformation**: Missing values are handled by filling them with the median (`RM`), and normalization is applied to the `'CRIM'` column.
5. **Data Validation**: We check for missing values and validate transformations.
6. **Data Interpretation**: Various visualizations (histogram, scatter plot, correlation heatmap, box plot, and pairplot) are used to interpret and explore relationships between variables.
