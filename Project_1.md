PROJECT_1 
  Summary of Tasks
Importing Data: We use pandas to read a CSV file into a DataFrame (df).
Data Frames: We use pandas methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe() to inspect the DataFrame.
Variables: Each column in the dataset is considered a variable (e.g., 'RM', 'CRIM', 'MEDV').
Data Transformation: Missing values are handled by filling them with the median (RM), and normalization is applied to the 'CRIM' column.
Data Validation: We check for missing values and validate transformations.
Data Interpretation: Various visualizations (histogram, scatter plot, correlation heatmap, box plot, and pairplot) are used to interpret and explore relationships between variables.
